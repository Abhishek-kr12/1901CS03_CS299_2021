# Iris Flower Prediction
<p>
In this prediction web app, we're predicting the classes of iris flower (Iris-setosova,Iris-versicolor and Iris-virginica) based on the various parameter.For this, I've used various various algorithms like logistic regression,K-Nearest Neighbour(KNN),Support Vector Machine(SVM),Decision Trees and Naive Bayes Classifier(all variant included) to check which algorithm giving the best result and I end up with using Logistic Regression algorithm. In the app , we'll have to give give inputs for Sepal Length,Sepal Width, Petal Length and Petal Width all in centimeters and in the output , we get that iris flower as output which is having the highest probability. The whole model is deployed on Heroku using the Flask framework. My whole work move around preparing the data, analysing the data,applying the algorithms, reducing the errors and predicting the output with efficient accuracy.
